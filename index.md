A multiplayer political format for Pokémon TCG focused on thematic decks and table interaction.

---

## What is Totem Format?

**Totem Format** is a multiplayer variant of Pokémon TCG designed for 3 to 6 players, where politics, negotiation, and threat management are as important as technical gameplay.

Each player builds a 100-card singleton deck around a **Totem Pokémon**, a special card that defines the deck’s color identity and serves as the strategic core of the deck.

The format preserves the **Prize Card system** to ensure full compatibility with official Pokémon TCG cards, adapting it to a multiplayer environment.
