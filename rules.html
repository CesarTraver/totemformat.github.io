            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>This format adapts Pokémon TCG for multiplayer play (3–X players), keeping Prize Cards compatible.
                Matches use rotating objectives, negotiation, and thematic singleton decks centered on a Totem Pokémon.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Totem Pokémon</h2>

            <h3>Definition and Gameplay Rules</h3>
            <p>The Totem is a Pokémon with a rule box that starts <strong>outside the deck</strong>, in the top-right
                corner.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is not active at the beginning of the game.</li>
                <li>It <strong>cannot attack or use abilities</strong> until it enters play.</li>
                <li>During your turn, you can assign energy to the Totem instead of your Pokémon; this counts as your
                    turn energy.</li>
                <li>The Totem <strong>cannot receive energies</strong> by card effects while it is outside the play
                    area.</li>
                <li>When the Totem has enough energy and there is space on the field, it <strong>automatically enters
                        play</strong> on the bench or active spot, replacing the current active Pokémon for free.</li>
                <li>If there are already 6 Pokémon in play, the Totem <strong>cannot enter</strong> until a space
                    becomes available.</li>
                <li>Any energy card that provides more than 1 energy at once counts for its full amount.
                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    <div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Neo Upper Energy</strong><img
                            src="ruleImages/neo-upper-energy.png" alt="NeoUpperEnergy" class="tooltip-image" /></div>
                    gives 2 multicolor energy to any Stage 2 Pokémon →
                    assigned to a Stage 2 Totem, it counts as 2 energies for the cost of 1.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Totem Defeat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>First defeat: invocation cost <strong>does not increase</strong>.</li>
                <li>Subsequent defeats: cost increases <strong>permanently by 1</strong> and cannot be reduced by card
                    effects.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Invocation Cost by Stage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic: 2 energies</li>
                <li>Stage 1: 3 energies</li>
                <li>Stage 2: 4 energies</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Basic Totem enters play with 2 energies and is defeated → returns to Totem zone without
                    increasing cost.</li>
                <li>The second defeat → invocation cost increases permanently to 3 energies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Deck Construction and Type Identity</h2>

            <p>Decks are built <strong>around the Totem</strong>, respecting its allowed types and attacks.</p>

            <h3>Deck Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> 100 cards (99 normal cards + 1 Totem).</li>
                <li><strong>Duplicates:</strong> Not allowed, except Basic Energy, which can be included in any
                    quantity.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeated Pokémon:</strong> Allowed only if from different expansions and have different
                    stats, attacks, or abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Forbidden:</strong> No cards with rule boxes (only the Totem can have one).</li>
                <li><strong>Pokémon types:</strong> All Pokémon must belong to the Totem’s allowed types.</li>
                <li><strong>Attacks:</strong> No attack may require Energy outside the Totem-defined types.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Deck Type Identity</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Totem’s <strong>base type</strong> is always allowed.</li>
                <li>Any Energy type required by the Totem’s attacks also counts as a <strong>base type</strong>, except
                    Colorless.</li>
                <li>If the Totem has <strong>retreat cost &gt; 0</strong>, Colorless Energy is allowed.</li>
                <li>If the Totem has <strong>retreat cost 0</strong>, Colorless Energy and Colorless Pokémon are not
                    allowed.</li>
                <li>If a Totem attack requires Colorless but the Totem has retreat cost 0:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Colorless <strong>does not count</strong> for deck construction.</li>
                        <li>Colorless Pokémon and special Energy providing Colorless <strong>cannot be
                                included</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the Totem’s <strong>retreat cost &gt; 1</strong>, your deck identity can include additional types
                    equal to the retreat cost minus 1:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One extra type is automatically assigned to Colorless.</li>
                        <li>Each remaining extra type can be chosen by you, but only one type per additional retreat
                            point.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>In the case of a Colorless Totem:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may freely choose additional types for your deck based on the retreat cost, without
                            subtracting 1 for Colorless.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br>
            <h3>Practical Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Totem type Dragon, attack requires Fire + Psychic + Colorless, retreat cost 1 → your deck can
                    include Dragon, Fire, Psychic, and Colorless Pokémon.</li>
                <img src="ruleImages/dragapult-ex.png" alt="DragapultEX" class="section-image" />
                <li>Totem type Water, attack requires Water only, retreat cost 2 → your deck must include Water and
                    Colorless; you may choose 1 additional type (e.g., Fire) as the second type.</li>
                <img src="ruleImages/Chienpao-ex.png" alt="Chien-PaoEX" class="section-image" />
                <li>Colorless Totem, retreat cost 2 → Colorless counts as base; you may freely choose 2 additional types
                    for the deck.</li>
                <img src="ruleImages/Kangaskhan-ex.png" alt="KangaskhanEX" class="section-image" />
                <li>Totem with retreat cost 0 → Colorless is <strong>not allowed</strong>, even if the attack requires
                    it.</li>
                <img src="ruleImages/Noivern-ex.png" alt="NoivernEX" class="section-image" />
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Prize Cards</h2>
            <p>Each player starts with 6 Prize cards.</p>
            <p>When a Pokémon is defeated, the controller takes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Normal Pokémon: 1 Prize</li>
                <li>Totem depends on rule box</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Prize Interactions</h2>
            <p>In the Totem format, Prize cards act similarly to "lives" and affect certain attacks, abilities, or
                effects. To maintain consistency:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whenever an effect, attack, or ability refers to the <strong>player's own prizes</strong> or an
                    opponent's prizes, <strong>swap the values of prizes</strong> between the active player and the
                    targeted opponent <em>for resolution purposes only</em>.</li>
                <li>This means that any calculations or effects that depend on the number of prizes will temporarily
                    consider the opponent’s prizes as the active player’s prizes and vice versa.</li>
                <li>The actual number of prize cards in hand or on the table does <strong>not change</strong>—only the
                    value used to resolve the effect is swapped.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Example 1: Attack Reduction Based on Prizes</h3>
            <p>
            <div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Ursaluna Crimson Moon EX</strong><img
                    src="ruleImages/CrimsonUrsalunaEX.png" alt="UrsalunaEX" class="tooltip-image" /></div> has an
            ability that reduces attack cost by 1 Colorless for every Prize the
            opponent has. In Totem format:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you (active player) have 1 Prize and your target opponent has 5 Prizes, for the purpose of
                    resolving Ursaluna's ability, it is considered as if your opponent has 1 Prize and you have 5.</li>
                <li>Effectively, you can now attack because the ability resolves according to the swapped values.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Example 2: <div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Iono</strong><img src="ruleImages/iono.png" alt="Iono"
                        class="tooltip-image" /></div>
            </h3>
            <p>
            <div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Iono</strong><img src="ruleImages/iono.png" alt="Iono"
                    class="tooltip-image" /></div> effect: "Each player shuffles the cards in their hand and puts them
            on the bottom of their deck.
            Then, for each Prize card remaining, the player draws 1 card."</p>
            <p>In Totem format:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you choose a rival and the effect depends on the number of Prize cards, the prizes are swapped
                    for resolution purposes.</li>
                <li>For example, if you have 2 Prizes left and the opponent has 5, when resolving the draw effect of
                    <div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Iono</strong><img src="ruleImages/iono.png" alt="Iono"
                            class="tooltip-image" /></div>, it is as if you have 5 Prizes and the opponent has 2.
                </li>
                <li>Each player then draws cards according to these temporary values, following the normal instructions
                    of <div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Iono</strong><img src="ruleImages/iono.png" alt="Iono"
                            class="tooltip-image" /></div>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>8. Rounds & Free Interaction</h2>

            <p>Matches in the Totem format are divided into <strong>full rounds</strong>, where each active player takes
                one
                turn in order. Unlike traditional target-based systems, the Totem format allows <strong>free
                    interaction</strong>
                between players, encouraging natural political decisions and dynamic gameplay.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>General Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>During your turn, you may attack <strong>any opponent</strong>, provided you follow standard Pokémon
                    TCG
                    rules.</li>
                <li>There are no assigned targets or mandatory opponents.</li>
                <li>Players are free to negotiate, form temporary alliances, or shift aggression based on the current
                    board
                    state.</li>
                <li>Eliminated players are immediately removed from the game and are no longer considered for any
                    effects.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Design Note</h3>
            <p>This free interaction model is designed to preserve player agency while allowing political pressure to
                emerge
                organically. Other rules within the Totem format prevent early focus and unfair eliminations.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>9. Combat & Anti-Focus Protection</h2>

            <p>To prevent early player elimination and repeated focus on a single opponent, the Totem format uses a
                <strong>progressive protection system</strong> based on repeated attacks.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Repeated Attack Protection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you attack the <strong>same player in consecutive rounds</strong>, all damage dealt by your
                    Pokémon to
                    that player is reduced by <strong>20</strong> for each consecutive round.</li>
                <li>This reduction only applies <strong>between the same two players</strong>.</li>
                <li>The damage reduction resets immediately if you attack a different player.</li>
                <li>This effect only reduces damage and does not prevent other effects such as Special Conditions,
                    discards,
                    or Ability effects.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Round 1: Player A attacks Player B → No reduction.</li>
                <li>Round 2: Player A attacks Player B again → Damage −20.</li>
                <li>Round 3: Player A attacks Player B again → Damage −40.</li>
                <li>Round 4: Player A attacks Player C → Reduction resets.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Strategic Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Players may still focus an opponent, but doing so becomes progressively inefficient.</li>
                <li>This system naturally encourages spreading damage and interacting with multiple players.</li>
                <li>Political agreements and threat assessment emerge without forced targeting.</li>

            <h2>10. Grace Totem Turn</h2>

            <p>To prevent unfair early eliminations, the Totem format includes a <strong>Grace Totem Turn</strong> rule.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Grace Totem Turn Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If a player has <strong>no Pokémon in play</strong> at any point outside of their own turn, they are
                    <strong>not immediately eliminated</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>That player gains a Grace Totem Turn and remains in the game until the end of their next turn.</li>
                <li>During their Grace Totem Turn, the player may:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Play Pokémon normally.</li>
                        <li>Use Trainer cards that <strong>search for Pokémon</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Activate their Totem Pokémon if possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the player still has no Pokémon in play at the end of their Grace Totem Turn, they are
                    eliminated.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Important Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This rule does not prevent elimination due to running out of Prize Cards.</li>
                <li>The Grace Totem Turn only applies once per instance of having no Pokémon in play.</li>
                <li>This rule significantly reduces early focus and allows players a fair chance to recover.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Items</h2>
            <p>Items in the Totem format can be played outside of your turn, allowing players to strategically influence
                the game even when it is not their turn.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player may play a maximum of <strong>1 Item</strong> outside of their turn per round.</li>
                <li>Items can target your own Pokémon or an opponent’s Pokémon. When targeting an opponent, you pay all
                    costs yourself.</li>
                <li>Item effects follow the standard Pokémon TCG rules unless otherwise specified by Totem format
                    mechanics.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Player A uses a “<div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Potion</strong><img
                            src="ruleImages/potion.png" alt="Potion" class="tooltip-image" /></div>” on their own
                    Pokémon during Player B’s turn.
                    The Pokémon heals normally.</li>
                <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Player C uses an “<div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Ultra
                            Ball</strong><img src="ruleImages/ultraball.png" alt="ultraball" class="tooltip-image" />
                    </div>” to search for a Pokémon for Player D.
                    Player C pays the cost (discard 2 cards) and Player D chooses which Pokémon is added to their hand.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Example 3:</strong> Player E plays a “<div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Switch</strong><img
                            src="ruleImages/switch.png" alt="Switch" class="tooltip-image" /></div>” on an opponent’s
                    Pokémon, moving it from
                    Active to Bench. Player E pays any costs associated with the Item.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Strategic Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This mechanic allows for political gameplay, enabling temporary alliances or interference with rival
                    strategies.</li>
                <li>Careful timing of Item use can significantly influence the flow of the round.</li>
                <li>Since only one Item can be used per round outside your turn, planning is critical to maximize
                    impact.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>11. Stadiums</h2>
            <p>In the Totem format, Stadium cards function mostly like in standard Pokémon TCG, with a few
                clarifications for multiplayer play.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only <strong>one Stadium</strong> may be in play at any time.</li>
                <li>If a new Stadium is played, the existing Stadium is discarded (as per standard TCG rules).</li>
                <li>All other Stadium rules follow the standard Pokémon TCG format, including effects that impact all
                    players.</li>
                <li>For Stadiums with directional effects (e.g., <em>
                        <div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Parallel City</strong><img src="ruleImages/parallelcity.png"
                                alt="parallelcity" class="tooltip-image" /></div>
                    </em>), the player who plays the
                    Stadium chooses the facing. The chosen effect applies to the player who played it, and the opposite
                    effect applies to all other players.</li>
                <li>Effects that reference “your Stadium” or “opponent’s Stadium” in standard TCG apply to the
                    controlling player and the targeted opponent respectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Player A plays <em>
                        <div class="card-tooltip"><strong>Parallel City</strong><img src="ruleImages/parallelcity.png"
                                alt="parallelcity" class="tooltip-image" /></div>
                    </em>. They choose the facing that
                    reduces damage from Grass, Fire, and Water Pokémon by 20. All other players receive the effect that
                    limits them to 3 Benched Pokémon.</li>
                <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Any Stadium that affects all Pokémon applies its effects to Totem
                    Pokémon as well, provided it does not contradict Totem-specific rules (e.g., energy assignment
                    restrictions).</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Strategic Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The facing mechanic allows the player who plays the Stadium to benefit themselves while imposing
                    constraints on opponents.</li>
                <li>Timing and selection of the facing are critical in multiplayer matches, as it can shift alliances or
                    influence which players are disadvantaged.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>12. Global Effect Restrictions</h2>

            <p>
                To preserve balance and prevent excessive disruption in multiplayer games, the Totem Format restricts
                how effects
                that would normally impact multiple players or the entire board are resolved.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>General Rule</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Supporter, Item, and Tool cards cannot affect all players at the same time.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any effect that would normally apply to “each player”, “all players”, or “both players” must instead
                    be resolved
                    by choosing a <strong>single opponent</strong>, unless the effect explicitly affects all Pokémon in
                    play or the
                    global game state.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Player-Targeted Effects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Supporters and Items that affect a player directly (such as drawing cards, discarding cards, or
                    shuffling hands)
                    apply only to the player who played the card and one chosen opponent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The player who plays the card chooses the affected opponent and pays all costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The effect is resolved only between those two players.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Pokémon-Targeted Effects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Effects or Abilities that affect <strong>all Pokémon in play</strong> affect Pokémon belonging to
                    all players.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Attacks that affect all Pokémon in play affect:
                    <ul>
                        <li>All Pokémon of the targeted opponent.</li>
                        <li>The attacking player’s Pokémon, if the attack text applies to them.</li>
                        <li>No Pokémon belonging to other non-targeted players.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stadium cards</strong> are the only card type allowed to affect multiple players
                    simultaneously.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cards that affect only the controller (for example, “draw cards” or “search your deck”) are not
                    restricted by
                    this rule.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Example 1:</strong> A Supporter that says “Each player shuffles their hand into their deck
                    and draws 4
                    cards.”
                    → The active player chooses one opponent. Only those two players resolve the effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Example 2:</strong> An Item that says “Discard all Tools attached to Pokémon in play.”
                    → All Pokémon in play discard their Tools, regardless of controller.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Example 3:</strong> A Tool that affects “both Active Pokémon.”
                    → The effect applies only to the active player’s Active Pokémon and the chosen opponent’s Active
                    Pokémon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Example 4:</strong> An attack that says “This attack does 20 damage to each Pokémon in
                    play.”
                    → Damage is applied to the targeted opponent’s Pokémon and to the attacker’s Pokémon if applicable,
                    but not to
                    other players.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Example 5:</strong> Froslass has an Ability that says
                    “During Pokémon Checkup, put 1 damage counter on each Pokémon that has an Ability
                    (both yours and your opponent’s), except Froslass.”
                    → This type of Ability affects <strong>all Pokémon with Abilities belonging to all
                        opponents</strong>,
                    as well as the controller’s Pokémon, following the card text.
                </li>
                <img src="ruleImages/froslass.png" alt="froslass" class="section-image" />

                <li>
                    <strong>Example 6:</strong> A Pokémon has an Ability that says:
                    “Once during your turn, when you play this Pokémon from your hand to evolve one of your Pokémon,
                    you may use this Ability. Switch 1 of your opponent’s Benched Pokémon with their Active Pokémon.”
                    → This is a <strong>targeted effect</strong> that refers to “your opponent”, not to “all Pokémon in
                    play”.
                    The player using the Ability chooses <strong>one opponent</strong>, and only that opponent’s Active
                    and
                    Benched Pokémon are affected. Other players’ Pokémon are not affected because the Ability does not
                    create a global game-state effect.
                </li>
                <img src="ruleImages/hariyama.png" alt="hariyama" class="section-image" />


            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Design Intent</h3>
            <p>
                These restrictions prevent a single card from disproportionately impacting multiple players at once,
                maintain
                strategic balance, and reinforce negotiation and political decision-making in multiplayer games.
