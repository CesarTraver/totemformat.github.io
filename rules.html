            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>This format adapts Pokémon TCG for multiplayer play (3–X players), keeping Prize Cards compatible.
                Matches use rotating objectives, negotiation, and thematic singleton decks centered on a Totem Pokémon.

            <h2>4. Totem Pokémon</h2>

            <h3>Definition and Gameplay Rules</h3>
            <p>The Totem is a Pokémon with a rule box that starts <strong>outside the deck</strong>, in the top-right
                corner.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is not active at the beginning of the game.</li>
                <li>It <strong>cannot attack or use abilities</strong> until it enters play.</li>
                <li>During your turn, you can assign energy to the Totem instead of your Pokémon; this counts as your
                    turn energy.</li>
                <li>The Totem <strong>cannot receive energies</strong> by card effects while it is outside the play
                    area.</li>
                <li>When the Totem has enough energy and there is space on the field, it <strong>automatically enters
                        play</strong> on the bench or active spot, replacing the current active Pokémon for free.</li>
                <li>If there are already 6 Pokémon in play, the Totem <strong>cannot enter</strong> until a space
                    becomes available.</li>
                <li>Any energy card that provides more than 1 energy at once counts for its full amount.
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Neo Upper Energy gives 2 multicolor energy to any Stage 2 Pokémon →
                    assigned to a Stage 2 Totem, it counts as 2 energies for the cost of 1.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Totem Defeat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>First defeat: invocation cost <strong>does not increase</strong>.</li>
                <li>Subsequent defeats: cost increases <strong>permanently by 1</strong> and cannot be reduced by card
                    effects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Invocation Cost by Stage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic: 2 energies</li>
                <li>Stage 1: 3 energies</li>
                <li>Stage 2: 4 energies</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Basic Totem enters play with 2 energies and is defeated → returns to Totem zone without
                    increasing cost.</li>
                <li>The second defeat → invocation cost increases permanently to 3 energies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Deck Construction and Type Identity</h2>

            <p>Decks are built <strong>around the Totem</strong>, respecting its allowed types and attacks.</p>

            <h3>Deck Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> 100 cards (99 normal cards + 1 Totem).</li>
                <li><strong>Duplicates:</strong> Not allowed, except Basic Energy, which can be included in any
                    quantity.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeated Pokémon:</strong> Allowed only if from different expansions and have different
                    stats, attacks, or abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Forbidden:</strong> No cards with rule boxes (only the Totem can have one).</li>
                <li><strong>Pokémon types:</strong> All Pokémon must belong to the Totem’s allowed types.</li>
                <li><strong>Attacks:</strong> No attack may require Energy outside the Totem-defined types.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Deck Type Identity</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Totem’s <strong>base type</strong> is always allowed.</li>
                <li>Any Energy type required by the Totem’s attacks also counts as a <strong>base type</strong>, except
                    Colorless.</li>
                <li>If the Totem has <strong>retreat cost &gt; 0</strong>, Colorless Energy is allowed.</li>
                <li>If the Totem has <strong>retreat cost 0</strong>, Colorless Energy and Colorless Pokémon are not
                    allowed.</li>
                <li>If a Totem attack requires Colorless but the Totem has retreat cost 0:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Colorless <strong>does not count</strong> for deck construction.</li>
                        <li>Colorless Pokémon and special Energy providing Colorless <strong>cannot be
                                included</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the Totem’s <strong>retreat cost &gt; 1</strong>, your deck identity can include additional types
                    equal to the retreat cost minus 1:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One extra type is automatically assigned to Colorless.</li>
                        <li>Each remaining extra type can be chosen by you, but only one type per additional retreat
                            point.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>In the case of a Colorless Totem:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may freely choose additional types for your deck based on the retreat cost, without
                            subtracting 1 for Colorless.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Practical Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Totem type Dragon, attack requires Fire + Psychic + Colorless, retreat cost 1 → your deck can
                    include Dragon, Fire, Psychic, and Colorless Pokémon.</li>
                <li>Totem type Water, attack requires Water only, retreat cost 2 → your deck must include Water and
                    Colorless; you may choose 1 additional type (e.g., Fire) as the second type.</li>
                <li>Colorless Totem, retreat cost 2 → Colorless counts as base; you may freely choose 2 additional types
                    for the deck.</li>
                <li>Totem with retreat cost 0 → Colorless is <strong>not allowed</strong>, even if the attack requires
                    it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>6. Prize Cards</h2>
            <p>Each player starts with 6 Prize cards.</p>
            <p>When a Pokémon is defeated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Normal Pokémon: 1 Prize</li>
                <li>Totem depends on rule box</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Prize Interactions</h2>
            <p>In the Totem format, Prize cards act similarly to "lives" and affect certain attacks, abilities, or
                effects. To maintain consistency:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whenever an effect, attack, or ability refers to the <strong>player's own prizes</strong> or an
                    opponent's prizes, <strong>swap the values of prizes</strong> between the active player and the
                    targeted opponent <em>for resolution purposes only</em>.</li>
                <li>This means that any calculations or effects that depend on the number of prizes will temporarily
                    consider the opponent’s prizes as the active player’s prizes and vice versa.</li>
                <li>The actual number of prize cards in hand or on the table does <strong>not change</strong>—only the
                    value used to resolve the effect is swapped.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example 1: Attack Reduction Based on Prizes</h3>
            <p>Ursaluna Crimson Moon EX has an ability that reduces attack cost by 1 Colorless for every Prize the
                opponent has. In Totem format:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you (active player) have 1 Prize and your target opponent has 5 Prizes, for the purpose of
                    resolving Ursaluna's ability, it is considered as if your opponent has 1 Prize and you have 5.</li>
                <li>Effectively, you can now attack because the ability resolves according to the swapped values.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example 2: E-Nigma</h3>
            <p>E-Nigma effect: "Each player shuffles the cards in their hand and puts them on the bottom of their deck.
                Then, for each Prize card remaining, the player draws 1 card."</p>
            <p>In Totem format:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you choose a rival and the effect depends on the number of Prize cards, the prizes are swapped
                    for resolution purposes.</li>
                <li>For example, if you have 2 Prizes left and the opponent has 5, when resolving the draw effect of
                    E-Nigma, it is as if you have 5 Prizes and the opponent has 2.</li>
                <li>Each player then draws cards according to these temporary values, following the normal instructions
                    of E-Nigma.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>8. Rounds & Objectives</h2>
            <p>Matches in the Totem format are divided into <strong>full rounds</strong>, where each player gets a turn
                in order. The primary focus is on assigned targets to create strategic gameplay.</p>

            <h3>Objective Assignment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At the beginning of each round, each player is assigned a <strong>Primary Target</strong>.</li>
                <li>The assignment is done using a <strong>dX die</strong>, where <em>X</em> equals the number of active
                    players.</li>
                <li>Players <strong>cannot target themselves</strong>, but targets may repeat across rounds.</li>
                <li>Eliminated players are removed from the target pool and will not receive new objectives.</li>
                <li>If a player is eliminated in the middle of a round and other players were assigned to attack them,
                    those players can <strong>choose new targets</strong> for the remainder of the round.</li>
                <li>The goal of this system is to balance attacks and encourage negotiation and alliances between
                    players.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example 1: Objective Assignment</h3>
            <p>Four players (A, B, C, D) are active. At the start of the round:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Player 1 rolls d4 → Target assigned: Player 3</li>
                <li>Player 2 rolls d4 → Target assigned: Player 4</li>
                <li>Player 3 rolls d4 → Target assigned: Player 1</li>
                <li>Player 4 rolls d4 → Target assigned: Player 3</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Players then must direct their attacks toward their assigned targets during the round.</p>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If a player is eliminated mid-game, the die pool for subsequent rounds is adjusted to exclude them.
                </li>
                <li>Players can strategize and negotiate with others to influence attacks or defend against specific
                    opponents.</li>
                <li>This rotation ensures that no single player can be consistently targeted unfairly while encouraging
                    political gameplay.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>9. Mandatory Attacks</h2>
            <p>In the Totem format, players are required to attack their assigned <strong>Primary Target</strong> each
                turn. This ensures active gameplay and enforces strategic political decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You must attack your assigned Primary Target if you are able to do so.</li>
                <li>If you choose to attack a different player instead of your assigned target, you must discard
                    <strong>7 cards</strong> from your hand as a penalty before performing the attack.
                </li>
                <li>Players may choose which cards to discard for the penalty.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example 1: Attacking Assigned Target</h3>
            <p>Player A is assigned Player B as a target. Player A attacks Player B normally. No penalty applies.</p>

            <h3>Example 2: Attacking a Different Player</h3>
            <p>Player C is assigned Player D as a target but prefers to attack Player B. Before doing so, Player C must
                discard 7 cards from their hand. The attack can then proceed.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This rule encourages players to carefully weigh the cost of attacking someone other than their
                    assigned target.</li>
                <li>Discarding 7 cards is a significant cost, so players must plan hand management and Pokémon placement
                    wisely.</li>
                <li>The mechanic maintains political tension, as players must decide between attacking their target or
                    paying to change focus.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>



        <section>
            <h2>10. Items</h2>
            <p>Items in the Totem format can be played outside of your turn, allowing players to strategically influence
                the game even when it is not their turn.</p>

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player may play a maximum of <strong>1 Item</strong> outside of their turn per round.</li>
                <li>Items can target your own Pokémon or an opponent’s Pokémon. When targeting an opponent, you pay all
                    costs yourself.</li>
                <li>Item effects follow the standard Pokémon TCG rules unless otherwise specified by Totem format
                    mechanics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Player A uses a “Potion” on their own Pokémon during Player B’s turn.
                    The Pokémon heals normally.</li>
                <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Player C uses an “Ultra Ball” to search for a Pokémon for Player D.
                    Player C pays the cost (discard 2 cards) and Player D chooses which Pokémon is added to their hand.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Example 3:</strong> Player E plays a “Switch” on an opponent’s Pokémon, moving it from
                    Active to Bench. Player E pays any costs associated with the Item.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategic Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This mechanic allows for political gameplay, enabling temporary alliances or interference with rival
                    strategies.</li>
                <li>Careful timing of Item use can significantly influence the flow of the round.</li>
                <li>Since only one Item can be used per round outside your turn, planning is critical to maximize
                    impact.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>11. Stadiums</h2>
            <p>In the Totem format, Stadium cards function mostly like in standard Pokémon TCG, with a few
                clarifications for multiplayer play.</p>

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only <strong>one Stadium</strong> may be in play at any time.</li>
                <li>If a new Stadium is played, the existing Stadium is discarded (as per standard TCG rules).</li>
                <li>All other Stadium rules follow the standard Pokémon TCG format, including effects that impact all
                    players.</li>
                <li>For Stadiums with directional effects (e.g., <em>Parallel City</em>), the player who plays the
                    Stadium chooses the facing. The chosen effect applies to the player who played it, and the opposite
                    effect applies to all other players.</li>
                <li>Effects that reference “your Stadium” or “opponent’s Stadium” in standard TCG apply to the
                    controlling player and the targeted opponent respectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Player A plays <em>Parallel City</em>. They choose the facing that
                    reduces damage from Grass, Fire, and Water Pokémon by 20. All other players receive the effect that
                    limits them to 3 Benched Pokémon.</li>
                <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Any Stadium that affects all Pokémon applies its effects to Totem
                    Pokémon as well, provided it does not contradict Totem-specific rules (e.g., energy assignment
                    restrictions).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategic Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The facing mechanic allows the player who plays the Stadium to benefit themselves while imposing
                    constraints on opponents.</li>
                <li>Timing and selection of the facing are critical in multiplayer matches, as it can shift alliances or
                    influence which players are disadvantaged.</li>
            </ul>
