## Why Totem Format?

Standard Pokémon TCG is designed for 1v1 competitive play.  
Multiplayer games often suffer from:

- Focus fire  
- Snowball leaders  
- Long waiting times  
- Unbalanced power spikes  

Totem Format solves this by:

- Preventing repeated attacks on the same player  
- Encouraging alliances  
- Adding strategic deck identity  
- Introducing Commander-style deck building

## Deck Construction

- Exactly 100 cards  
- Singleton rule (only one copy of each card, except basic Energy)  
- One Totem Pokémon that represents your deck  
- All Pokémon must share at least one type with your Totem  
- Expanded card pool

## Gameplay Overview

- 3–6 players  
- Turn order rotates normally  
- You cannot attack the same opponent twice in a row  
- Special Totem interactions influence the table
