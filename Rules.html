        <li>No duplicates except Basic Energy.</li>
        <li>Pokémon can repeat only if from different expansions and with different stats, attacks, or abilities.</li>
        <li>No cards with rule boxes allowed in the deck.</li>
        <li>All Pokémon must be exclusively of Totem Pokémon defined types.</li>
        <li>Attacks must not require Energies outside Totem Pokémon types.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Totem Pokémon</h2>
      <p>Definition: Totem is a Pokémon with rule box, starts in top-right corner outside the play area. Not active initially.</p>
      <p>Type Identity:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Totem base type always allowed.</li>
        <li>Totem attack energy types count as base (except Colorless).</li>
        <li>If Totem has retreat cost &gt; 0, Colorless Energy allowed.</li>
        <li>If Totem has 0 retreat cost, Colorless not allowed.</li>
        <li>If Totem attack uses Colorless but retreat is 0: Colorless ignored, cannot include Colorless Pokémon or special Energy giving Colorless.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Invocation Cost:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic: 2 energies</li>
        <li>Stage 1: 3 energies</li>
        <li>Stage 2: 4 energies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>During your turn, assign an energy to Totem instead of Pokémon; counts as your turn energy.</p>

      <p>Entering Play: Totem must enter automatically when enough energy and space exists. Can go to bench or active slot, removing current active for free. Cannot add last energy if Totem would auto-enter but space is blocked.</p>

      <p>Defeat: First defeat no cost increase. Subsequent defeats increase cost permanently by 1, cannot be reduced by effects.</p>
    </section>

        <li>Normal Pokémon: 1 Prize</li>
        <li>Totem: depends on rule box</li>
